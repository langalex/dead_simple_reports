== dead simple reports ==

this rails plugin allows you to easily create and view arbitrary reports of your database tables. it therefore creates a reports controller with views and a report model in your application. to create a report you simply create an instance of Report. it then appears in the list of reports where you can view it either as html table or csv data.

=== to create a report ===

Report.create! :name => 'My Ruby Report', :kind => 'code', :code => 'User.find(:all).map(:&name)'

This will generate a report that lists all user's names. 

Alternatively you can create a sql report:

Report.create! :name => 'My SQL Report', :kind => 'sql', :code => 'SELECT name FROM users'

to view the list of reports just go to http://localhost:3000/reports

=== customizing the views ===

to customzie the views you can simply edit the files under app/views/reports in your application.
